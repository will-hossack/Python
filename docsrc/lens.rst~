============
Lens Classes
============

Set of claases to handel full ray tracing of lenses.


CurrentLens functions
=====================

There are two functions that control the default lens used in the package.
These are mainly to simply the GUI interface.

.. autofunction:: optics.lens.setCurrentLens

and the getter function

.. autofunction:: optics.lens.getCurrentLens

If there is no CurrectLens set, it defaults the default SimpleSinglet.

OpticalGroup Class
==================

Basic class for lenes to hold list of OpticalSurfaces.

.. autoclass:: optics.lens.OpticalGroup
   :members:

Lens Class
==========

Class extending for lens with extra methods to make it s easier to call.

.. autoclass:: optics.lens.Lens
   :members:

Singlet Class
=============

Class for a general singlet lens with extra methods to set the parameters.

.. autoclass:: optics.lens.Singlet
   :members:

SimpleSinglet Class
===================

Simpler interface to Singlet to form a thin singlet lens specified by focal length, bend and radius.

.. autoclass:: optics.lens.SimpleSinglet
   :members:


Doublet Class
=============

Class to handle a doublet

.. autoclass:: optics.lens.Doublet
   :members:

Prism Class
===========

Class to implement a glass prism with methods to calcualte resolution, minimum deviation.

.. autoclass:: optics.lens.Prism
   :members:
      
DataBaseLens Class
==================

Class to read a lens from an input file, this the main user intreface to read in pre-definwed lenses.

.. autoclass:: optics.lens.DataBaseLens
   :members:
 
OpticalSystem Class
===================

Class to represent an optical system with is a list which in an extension of the Lens class. It can hold multiple OpticalGroups  (or Lens)
with methods to manipulate the whole system or individual components. This class will work with any of the analysis tools.

.. autoclass:: optics.lens.OpticalSystem
   :members:
