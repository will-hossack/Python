Ray Class
=========

The base class in the Ray, which is abstract with the useful extensing
classes being ParaxialRay and Intensity ray.

.. autoclass:: optics.ray.Ray
   :members:

RayMonitor Class
================

A RayMonitor can be attached to each Ray that is automatically updated every time the ray propated. The abstarct RayMonitor
class is specifed as:

.. autoclass:: optics.ray.RayMonitor
   :members:

but is actually used via its extennding clases.

.. autoclass:: optics.ray.PrintPath
   :members:

which prints the values of the ray as it is updated, and

.. autoclass:: optics.ray.RayPath
   :members:

which records the ray path in internal lists that can then be plotted via the .draw() method.
      

ParaxialRay Class
=================

Thhs class definbes Paraxial Rays which work with the optics.matrix classes.

.. autoclass:: optics.ray.ParaxialRay
   :members:
