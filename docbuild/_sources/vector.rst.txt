Vector Classes
==============

These classes handle two and three dimensional vectors with many supporting
methods to simplfy their use. These classes are used throughout the optics
package but can also be used as stand alone classes for other applications.

Note these vector classes are all interally hand coded and do not use
Numpy.

Vector2d Class
==============

Class for two dimensional vectors. This class is typically used to describe
point in planes.

.. autoclass:: vector.Vector2d
   :members:



Vector3d Class
==============

Class for three dimensional vectrors. This is main class used in specifiy
rays and reay tracing in the optics package.

.. autoclass:: vector.Vector3d
   :members:

Unit3d Class
============

Extending class to handle unit three dimensional vectors, this class is
typically used for ray directions.

.. autoclass:: vector.Unit3d
   :members:

Angle Class
===========

 Class to implwmwnt a unit vector using theta/psi angles

 .. autoclass:: vector.Angle
    :members:
